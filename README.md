A Hotspot is a way to provide wireless internet access to subscribers by means of an easy to use login interface.

This gives the owner of the hotspot full control over download limitations, speed/bandwidth management, and billing. A hotel, coffee shop, or conference center is a perfect example where a Hotspot would be implemented.
